# UART projects
This repository provides an examples of how to use UART with microcontrollers in various configurations.


## 1. [ESP32 UART Simple Example](esp32_simple/)
### Why?
- It was quite the effort to get 2 esp32 devices with SPIRAM to speak to each other over a simple UART.
- It seemed like the information was hidden, but it was just not obvious.

## 2. [ESP32 UART RS-422 Example](esp32_rs422e/)
### Why?
- Oddly enough, it was quite the effort to get 2 esp32 devices to speak to each other over rs-422 modules.
- Yet again, it seemed like the information was hidden, but it was just not obvious.

Here's a nice short video on UART (not mine) to get started as well:
