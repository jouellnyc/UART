## Raspi Pico and SIM800L 

##  BackStory
My goal was to get a little bit more involved in Internet of Things From a cellular perspective, not spending a ton of money up front. To that end I did some research and it appeared that the SimCom sim800l module would be a perfect fit.  I went ahead and purchased five of these modules from AliExpress, knowing that a few of them weren't going to work. Sure enough three of them did not power up one of them had a bent SIM card holder but two of them did power up. 

##  Upfront lesson:
Always by at least two of the items from Ali Express

##  Spoiler Alert
This was a partial success. 


| Prerequisite | Details |
|---|---|
| Pi Pico |
|Sim800L| Anywhere on AliExpress| Just grab one|

## UART Pin Configuration

| Module | Pico |
|---|---|
| SIM800L TX | GPIO 01 |
| SIM800L RX | GPIO 00 |
| SIM800L GND | GND|

Pretty Straight Forward in terms of connections:

```
#gsmuart.py

import machine
import time
uart = machine.UART(0, baudrate=115200, tx=machine.Pin(0), rx=machine.Pin(1))
```

## Other Pins

| Module | Pico |
|---|---|
| SIM800L VCC | 5V |
| SIM800L GND | GND |


### Tips from Arduino Forum
```
You should be very careful to:

-  Disconnect VCC first
-  Connect    GND first

Otherwise, the module can use the low voltage serial pins as ground and can get destroyed instantly.
```

### Notes from Arduino Forum
```
**Blink every 1s:**The module is running but hasnâ€™t made connection to the cellular network yet.
**Blink every 2s:**The GPRS data connection you requested is active.
**Blink every 3s:**The module has made contact with the cellular network & can send/receive voice and SMS.
```

### Vendors

#### I first tried with Hologram.io.

I tried first by putting  the sim800L upto near my  window using USB power to the pico and 5V wall power for the simb00l.

I connected a few times. But only about 3 or 4 in a short window of time. Out of probably a 100 attempts over a few days.


I tried on the roof:

I tried being mobile in an open area:

Really never got a consistent connect after the first few times.


Support told me it's a dice roll for now:

NOTE: There is very little in terms of how to *actually get online* with a microcontroller using a consistent step by step process. 

It's mostly anecdotes here and there that you cobble together (voila!).

### Connected 

I connected a few times. I live in NYC , in a lively connected city, so I figured connectivity would be fine... 

This was pretty cool. I actually connected:

```
>>> uart.write(b"AT+CNETSCAN\r\n"); time.sleep(5); print(uart.read())
13
b'\r\nOperator:"T-Mobile USA",MCC:310,MNC:260,Rxlev:53,Cellid:CF00,Arfcn:1709\r\n\r\nOK\r\n'

>>> uart.write(b"AT+CENG=2\r\n"); time.sleep(5); print(uart.read())
11
b'AT+CENG=2\r\r\nOK\r\n\r\n+CENG: 0,"0685,57,00,310,260,16,cf00,04,00,7d73,255"
                       \r\n+CENG: 1,"1585,34,27,310,260,7d73"
                       \r\n+CENG: 2,"1636,28,13,310,260,7d73"
                       \r\n+CENG: 3,"1637,20,49,310,260,7d73"
                       \r\n+CENG: 4,"1634,16,11,310,260,7d73"
                       \r\n+CENG: 5,"1662,41,00,,,0000"  /\----- seems to be the 'lac'
                       \r\n+CENG: 6,"1663,41,00,,,0000"
                       \r\n'
```


Given the diagnostic info, I was able to find my myself on a map after following the GPS reference and converting:

```
>>> int(0xCF00)
52992

>>> int(0xCF01)
52993

>>> int(0x7d73)
32115

```

So that was pretty cool.


## Takeaways/ Learnings
- Keep your costs low and test out vendors before commiting. They tend to believe "Everything is Awesome".
